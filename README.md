## Summary

We present a framework for petrophysically and geologically guided inversion to perform multi-physics joint inversions. Petrophysical and geological information is included in a multi-dimensional Gaussian mixture model that regularizes the inverse problem. The inverse problem we construct consists of a suite of three cyclic optimizations over the geophysical, petrophysical and geological information. The two additional problems over the petrophysical and geological data are used as a coupling term. They correspond to updating the geophysical reference model and regularization weights. This guides the inverse problem towards reproducing the desired petrophysical and geological characteristics. The objective function that we define for the inverse problem is comprised of multiple data misfit terms: one for each geophysical survey and one for the petrophysical properties and geological information. Each of these misfit terms has its own target misfit value which we seek to fit in the inversion. Our framework is modular and extensible and this allows us to combine multiple geophysical methods in a joint inversion and to distribute open-source code and reproducible examples. To illustrate the gains made by multi-physics inversions, we apply our framework to jointly invert, in 3D, synthetic potential fields data based on the DO-$27$ kimberlite pipe case study (Northwest Territories, Canada). The pipe contains two distinct kimberlite facies embedded in a host rock. We show that inverting the datasets individually, even with petrophysical information, leads to a binary geologic model consisting of background or kimberlite. A joint inversion, with petrophysical information, can differentiate the two main kimberlite facies of the pipe.

## Usage

To run the notebooks locally, you will need to have python installed,
preferably through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) .

You can then clone this repository. From a command line, run

```
git clone https://github.com/simpeg-research/Astic-2020-JointInversion.git
```

Then `cd` into the `Astic-2020-JointInversion` directory:

```
cd Astic-2020-JointInversion
```

To setup your software environment, we recommend you use the provided conda environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pgijoint-environment
```


alternatively, you can install dependencies through pypi

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then launch Jupyter

```
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter will then launch in your web-browser.

## Running the notebooks

Each cell of code can be run with `shift + enter` or you can run the entire notebook by selecting `cell`, `Run All` in the toolbar.

For more information on running Jupyter notebooks, see the [Jupyter Documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Issues

Please [make an issue](https://github.com/simpeg-research/Astic-2020-JointInversion/issues) if you encounter any problems while trying to run the notebooks.
